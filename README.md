# Astronomical Image Processing of SWIRE Survey Dataset
By Mukesh Dharanibalan and Karam Ramzan | CID : 02107745 and _________ | md1021@ic.ac.uk and kr521@ic.ac.uk
------------------------------------
__Project Description__:
Short yet extensive image processing and analysis of SWIRE R-band astronomical image processing. Blooming, and star's correction are done. 
Galaxy number and their magnitude distributions are studied, with concurrence of different galactic models studied with results.
Results are compared with literature to evaluated validity, and limitations associated with the dataset and analysis.

------------------------------------
__Build Status__:

Current build v1.0.0:
Astrocode-Final.py : full image processing, with visualisation of processed images, completeness of dataset estimation and statistical studies.

------------------------------------
__Code Style and Framework__:
This strictly follows standard PEP-8 formatting and convention. It requires understanding of matplotlib, numpy, sci-kit image, and scipy modules.

All functions and processing methods have self-explanatory names, with extensive commenting for further clarity.

------------------------------------
__How to use__:
Must have the exact same dataset, 'mosaic.fits' files in the same directory as the code file for imports to work propperly.
Simply running the rest of the code will provide the necessary results, including a saved FITS file of the processed image.
